# Visualizations of the Sources of Wittgenstein's Works

This repository contains visualizations of the correspondence between
Wittgenstein's posthumous works (edited by the Nachlass executors) and the
sources in Wittgenstein's Nachlass. Visualizations for the _Remarks on the
Foundations of Mathematics_ (RFM) are provided in the format A3, while more
experimental visualizations of most of the remaining published works are
provided in the format A2. All visualizations are provided as PDFs as well as
the TeX files that were used to produce the PDFs. (Unfortunately it is not
possible to publish the source code used to generate the TeX files, as it
depends on the Nachlass XML data of the Wittgenstein Archives Bergen, which are
not publicly released.)

## Examples

## What Counts as a "Work" by Wittgenstein?

The “works” of Wittgenstein that were published after his death by the three
literary executors G.E.M. Anscombe, Rush Rhees and Georg Henrik von Wright have
often been the target of criticism, giving rise to the question of what can even
be considered a “work” by Wittgenstein. The _Remarks on the Foundations of
Mathematics_ (RFM), first published in 1956 and then heavily revised and
expanded in 1974, are certainly one of the most problematic publications in this
regard, as the literary executors themselves pointed out:

> The _Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics_ occupy a nearly unique, and
> not altogether happy, position among the posthumous publications. In addition
> to the relatively finished Part I, corresponding to typescripts 222, 223, and
> 224 of the catalogue and constituting the second half of the pre-war version
> of the _Investigations_, the _Remarks_ contain _selections_ from several
> manuscripts (117, 121, 122, 124, 125, 126, and 127). In the revised edition of
> 1974 (English translation 1978) the selections from those manuscripts were
> somewhat enlarged and a further manuscript (164) which was not known to the
> editors at the time of the first edition was added, practically without
> omissions. A publication of the manuscripts _in toto_, however, seemed to us
> excluded even at the time of preparing the new edition. [von Wright,
> "Philosophical Occasions", 1993, p. 502]

## How to Read the Visualisations

The visualisations on the following pages present the editorial decisions
described above for the _RFM_ (in A3) and more experimentally for most of the
remaining works (in A2), with one visualisation per part of a work. Each image
shows three columns of remarks, ordered from top to bottom as they appear in the
published work of the source documents. The remarks in the different columns are
connected if they correspond to each other, either because a remark in the
published work is identical (with minimal textual changes) to a remark in the
source document or because a remark in a source document also appears in other
related documents. The column on the left displays the remarks that are included
in the published work, with diamond markers indicating the section boundaries in
the work (and section numbers to the left). The column in the middle shows the
remarks of one or several source documents (with page numbers to the right) that
form the basis of the published work. The column on the right displays the
remarks of secondary documents (with page numbers to the right) with textually
similar remarks in the source document of the published work.

By displaying the connections from the published work (on the left) to the
source documents (in the middle), the visualisation shows where the published
work originates and which parts of the source document were reordered / excluded
/ inserted. By displaying the connection from the source document (in the
middle) to the related documents (on the right), the visualisation can often
hint at the reason why a particular segment was or was not published.

To the left of the vertical document lines (in the middle and right columns)
appears a kind of bar code pattern of short horizontal lines with small or
larger circle markers directly to the left. These lines and markers indicate
that the remark is published in the work currently being visualised (indicated
by a slightly larger circle marker) or is published in other works (either other
parts of the work in question or other works, both indicated by a small circle
marker).

Longer horizontal lines, both solid and densely dotted, which cross the document
lines (in the middle and right columns) indicate a break between adjacent
remarks in the document. Solid lines indicate a separating line by Wittgenstein
himself, densely dotted lines indicate a chronological break of more than 30
days between remarks.
